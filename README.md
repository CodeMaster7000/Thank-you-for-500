# Thank you for 500!

Late at night on 20th August 2024, we hit 500 followers on Github! 🎉🎉🎉

I would like to say a huge thank you to every single one of you for helping me along this journey. Whether you have followed, starred my repositories or simply taken the time to view my Github profile, I would like to take a moment to remind you that all of your actions have helped. Without all of you, none of the milestones we have reached so far would be possible. Your unwavering support has been the driving force for me to continue uploading projects across all skill levels on a regular basis, and I hope to continue receiving such encouragement from you all in the future. Albeit coming from a humble developer, I firmly believe the sky is the limit. ⭐

Happy coding,
CodeMaster7000
